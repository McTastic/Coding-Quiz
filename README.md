# 04 Coding Quiz

Here is a quiz with 10 multiple choice questions that pertain to Javascript and HTML. Each question has 4 choices and the user will gain 10 points when they select the correct answer and will then move on to the next question. If the user chooses an incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be subtracted from the timer. All questions are randomly shuffled every time the quiz is started. 

At the end of the quiz, the user will be presented with a screen which is different depending on the circumstances. If the time runs out, the user will be presented with a message which states that the time has run out and they will see their score. If they reach the end of the quiz, they will see a "Great job!" message instead of the "Time's up!" message. The score they receive will be 10 points per question, plus an additional point per second of time remaining on the clock at the end of the quiz. 

If the user achieves a "high score", then they are presented with an option at the end of the quiz to enter their name, and they will be redirected to a page which displays the 3 high scores. The user will be able to compete with their previous scores and those previous scores will move down a place if the user manages to beat them. All high scores are saved to local storage.
